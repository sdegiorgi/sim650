History

0.4 beta (_no_ compatibility to prior versions/sources!):
- major: changed program/drum start to 0001
- drum (datatype chosen is array) now inits up to drumSize+1 ([0] unused)
- changed loadSource to reflect that offset
- adjusted fibobmi.650, fibonze.650, fibonzu.650, jd_division.650 and
  ma_divide.650
- added source ma_infinite_loop.650 using an NZE branch to create an
  endless loop
- added source fibonze_console_input.650 to demonstrate reading console
  input for the desired value of n for f(n) (using nze branching)
  may also be used as reference for "variable initialization"
- added method explainDrumData() that dumps drum and explains each word
  (buggy (!!) with constants >99999999 - ambiguity issue with ops, yet
  no workaround or try/catch)
- added methods set/getConsoleInput to help simulating console input
  (readable via address 8000)
- extended distributor to simulate reads off console (address 8000)

0.3 beta:
- added method runWithTraces() to run the program with printout of
  information on Step, Address, Mnemonic, OPCode, D Address, I Address,
  Distributor, Lower Accu and Upper Accu in a tabular form

0.2 still-beta:
- distributor now can load data off 8002 and 8003 (acc)
- added chessboard.650 source
- changed sim default values of maxIter to 1000 and drumSize to 100
- ALO Operation (15) now reflects overflow and adds carry to upper acc
- added checkSource(file) method to auto test sources on plausibility

0.1 very-beta:
- proof of concept
